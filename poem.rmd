The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square    
With the new city street it has to wear    
A number in. But what about the brook    
That held the house as in an elbow-crook?    
I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength    
And impulse, having dipped a finger length    
And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed    
A flower to try its currents where they crossed.    
The meadow grass could be cemented down    
From growing under pavements of a town;    
The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.    
Is water wood to serve a brook the same?    
How else dispose of an immortal force    
No longer needed? Staunch it at its source    
With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown    
Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone    
In fetid darkness still to live and run â€”    
And all for nothing it had ever done       
Except forget to go in fear perhaps.    
No one would know except for ancient maps
